# Expiscan

An Android mobile application (Flutter) made to scan and track food product's expiry date. This app uses OCR [Firebase ML Kit](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/tree/master/packages/firebase_ml_vision) to recognize barcodes and expiry date texts. It also fetches [Open Food Facts](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) for product's data (e.g. name and image)

Run
`flutter pub get`
Then
`flutter run`
